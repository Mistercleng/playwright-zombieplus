##  About

This is the automated testing project repository for the Zombie Plus system, developed as part of the Playwright Zombie Edition course.

Playwright is a powerful open-source testing framework created by Microsoft that is transforming the way we automate web applications. It enables fast, reliable, and highly maintainable end-to-end tests across modern browsers such as Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

## Throughout the course, you will learn how to:
- Set up Playwright from scratch in a real-world Node.js project
- Write reliable and expressive tests using Playwright Test
- Interact with web elements via locators, assertions, and custom selectors
- Work with dynamic waits and handle asynchronous UI updates effectively
- Structure your project using the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- Create reusable test flows and helper utilities
- Run tests in parallel and isolate test contexts
- Automate browser actions such as file uploads, downloads, and multi-tab interactions
- Execute tests across multiple browsers and devices
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated test execution
- Use Playwrightâ€™s trace viewer and debugging tools for efficient troubleshooting

By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have a solid understanding of how to build and scale a robust web automation test suite using Playwright, and you'll have a complete working example project (Zombie Plus) to refer to.
